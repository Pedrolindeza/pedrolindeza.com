<h1>FAQ - Pedro's Fish Allergy</h1>

<div class="container">
    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: Are you allergic to all fish?</h2>
        <p>A: Yes, my allergy is specific to parvalbumin, a protein found in fish muscles. This means I'm allergic to all types of fish.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: What about seafood?</h2>
        <p>A: Seafood often contains parvalbumin, so I am also allergic to seafood like shrimp, crab, and lobster.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: What happens if you eat fish?</h2>
        <p>A: If I consume fish, it can lead to allergic reactions which may range from mild symptoms like hives and itching to severe reactions like difficulty breathing, and in extreme cases, it can be life-threatening.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: When did you find out about your allergy?</h2>
        <p>A: I discovered my allergy to parvalbumin when I had a reaction after consuming fish at the age of 1. It was confirmed through allergy testing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: Can I still eat fish that has been extensively processed?</h2>
        <p>A: Even extensively processed fish products can contain traces of parvalbumin, so I need to avoid all forms of fish entirely.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <h2>Q: How can I help someone with a parvalbumin allergy?</h2>
        <p>A: It's crucial to be aware of their allergy and ask if they carry an epinephrine (adrenaline) auto-injector (like an EpiPen). In case of a severe allergic reaction, using the auto-injector and seeking immediate medical attention is essential.</p>
